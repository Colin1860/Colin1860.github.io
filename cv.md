## Summary
Passionate engineer with 5+ years plus experience building non-trivial software and sensor systems. Currently, my special interests are focused on WebAssembly in constrained environments, fingerprinting and pattern matching algorithms, as well as localization techniques. 

When I am not building something, I enjoy cooking, being outside or practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

## Experience
- **Lead Software Engineer**, Helsing GmbH

    _Munich, Germany_

    _February 2024 - present_

  At Helsing, I am the longest tenured software engineer of the entire Electronic Warfare domain. I either built up or was part of building up every core software product needed in this domain. This ranges from domain specific databases to simulators used for synthetic data generation for training of AI models.

  After half a year as an IC, I was tasked with building up a team for the development of a [real-time electronic support measures system](https://helsing.ai/de/cirra). Within the scope of this task, I'm growing a team from originally 4 members to 12, all while designing the fundamental solution for this product, ranging from algorithmic advancements, highly concurrent design of the core system and enabling an organisation of 40+ people to contribute seamlessly to this codebase.

  Additionally, I'm an engineering manager for 3 engineers and I'm responsible for parts of our company wide onboarding process for engineers.

- **Embedded Software Engineer**, Zenseact AB

    _Gothenburg, Sweden_

    _April 2023 - February 2024_

    Continued to apply my experiences and skills in the automotive industry. This time focused on real time data collection. The challenge is in collecting complex data in a constrained environment, meeting certain timely requirements as well as scaling this solution in a way that other teams can use this tracing engine while keeping up the integrity of the engine. I benefit highly from my knowledge of real time operating systems at this task.

    Even though I wasn't there long, I already made substantial contributions to the scaleability of the solution. 
    Furthermore, I was also working on getting one of the first, non critical, Rust components into Zenseacts tech stack.

- **Software Engineer**, Einride AB

    _Gothenburg, Sweden_

    _June 2022 - April 2023_

    My position was located at the team responsible for the remote operation and driving capabilities of the autonomous truck developed by Einride. That included maintaining and developing a very complex architecture consisting of different hardware (state of the art embedded devices for robotics, microcontroller, industrial computers and cameras) and different kinds of software (embedded software parts, highly concurrent desktop applications, protocols and microservices), developing new features across the stack to future proof the remote operation stack as well as work sharing with more perception focused teams.

    The software stack was mostly Rust based with some parts in Go. Examples of the work I've done at Einride include writing communication protocols from scratch, improvement of AR-Elements and collecting video streaming statistics.

    Additionally, I engaged myself in various endeavors across teams, like hosting Rust workshops and participating in various Platform-Guild meetings.

- **Software Engineer**, Jambit GmbH

    _Munich, Germany_

    _Mar. 2022 - June 2022_

    Development of a Webapp for searching, creating and collecting of smart recipes for a German household appliances manufacturer
    
    Tasks ranged from parallelizing queries and other requests and optimizing the search engine, to setting up a user and customer database with role hierarchy and permission concept for different views of the webshop.

- **Software Engineer (part-time)**, Jambit GmbH

    _Munich, Germany_

    _Mar. 2021 - Mar. 2022_

    I was working on the same microservice application as during my internship for 2 months. Mostly working on refactorings and additional API-Endpoints.

    Building a Hardware in the loop simulation system on a Raspberry Pi using Python. The System simulates the support-cylinder of a camper-van.

- **Software Engineer (Internship)**, Jambit GmbH

    _Munich, Germany_

    _Sept. 2020 - Mar. 2021_

    I was working on a distributed microservice application using Spring Boot, Java, GraphQL, REST, MongoDB and RabbitMQ.

    Built and deployed this service utilizing Docker container, Kubernetes and  AzureDevOps.

    Developed an easy-to-use Content Management System, Translation Request System and a Role-Service for authentication within this application

- **Software Engineer (part-time)**, Jambit GmbH

    _Munich, Germany_

    _Mar. 2020 - Sep. 2020_

    My tasks included working on a Windows Store App targeting smart offices utilizing the UWP-Framework and C\#.

    Implemented several features of the app including but not limited to: collecting data of user interaction utilizing an SQLite database, which was visually processed for the user

    A feature to export settings of the user to a storage device, which then can be applied on other configurations (different desk or lamp).

## Projects

- **Sguaba - hard-to-misuse rigid body transforms** — https://github.com/helsing-ai/sguaba  
  This is an open source library that I helped stabilize and rollout and internally, and now I help with maintianing it. It's main purpose is to cleverly utilize Rust's type system so that rigid body transforms (eg, from one coordinate system into another) are harder to get wrong.

- **Gossip Glomers - Distributed systems challenge** - https://github.com/Colin1860/gossip-glomers
  My take on challenge 6 of the distributed systems challenge from fly.io. In this challenge I built a totally available, [read-commited](https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/read-committed) distributed key value store in Rust.
